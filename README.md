# Hotel-Reservation-App
This is the first project in the Java Nanoprogram degree of Udacity.

In this project, i designed and implemented a Java hotel reservation application.

The hotel reservation application allows customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability.

The major components of the Hotel Reservation Application will consist of the following:

  - CLI for the User Interface :  the Command Line Interface, the user can enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and so on.

  - Java code : the second main component is the Java code itselfâ€”this is where i add the business logic for the app.

  - Java collections : Finally, i use Java collections for in-memory storage of the data i need for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.
